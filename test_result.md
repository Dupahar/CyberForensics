    message: "All backend API endpoints have been successfully tested. The backend is working correctly with no major issues. Tests verified health check, case management, evidence upload/retrieval, data export (JSON/CSV), and export history functionality. SHA-256 hash generation and verification is working properly. UTC timestamp formatting is correct. Error handling for invalid requests is also working as expected."

    message: "Frontend testing completed. The UI components render correctly but there are API connectivity issues. The frontend cannot connect to the backend API, resulting in 'Failed to fetch' errors. The About page works correctly as it doesn't require API calls. The Dashboard, Case Creation, Case Detail View, Evidence Upload, and Export Panel UIs are implemented but cannot be functionally tested due to the API connectivity issues. The UI is responsive and works well on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)."
