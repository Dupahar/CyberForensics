    message: "All backend API endpoints have been successfully tested. The backend is working correctly with no major issues. Tests verified health check, case management, evidence upload/retrieval, data export (JSON/CSV), and export history functionality. SHA-256 hash generation and verification is working properly. UTC timestamp formatting is correct. Error handling for invalid requests is also working as expected."
